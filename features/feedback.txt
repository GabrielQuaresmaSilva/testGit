- Features
--- The 3 features presented describe the mandatory requirements, no extra feature is described
--- The scenarios provide the "free text" search

- Scenarios
--- "a JSon object" ????? really ??? how is the user going to see it?
--- In the "Scenario Outline: Speaker Detail Page - Check speakers social networks" your test should stop before
"redirecting to <link>" since there is no way to redirect to "no link" (as given in the examples table)
--- In the feature "PresentSpeakerDetailPage" why not use the "Background" for a set of scenarios that have exactly
the same "Given"-"When"? You have used it elsewhere.
--- In the "Scenario Outline: Write keyword to search profile card information - Dont found information" - the last
column in the examples table is not necessary - it's the same value for all the examples.

- Gherkin
--- Consistency should be achieved (the validation of the speaker photo is not the same for the social network logo -
aren't they all images?)
--- Correct usage of backgrounds (sometimes!), scenario outlines, examples tables and scenarios

Version Control System Usage
- Commit messages are explanatory but the text could be improved
--- What was the update conducted in the commit "updated feature LandingPage"?
- One of the members of the team does not appear as contributor of the repository
--- A balanced throughput of the commits shows an equally distributed work load

English
- There are some (few) typos. Nothing serious.
